# Information_retrieval

This project is part of an assignment I received in a college course.<br>
The aim of the project was to experience working in the field of NLP.<br>
We conducted a number of experiments on a large(31,400 documents) dataset of tweets from Twitter, <br>
created visualizations to retrieve information from the dataset, and generally built a pipeline to clean the data.<br>

Aside from the main goal of the project, I set myself the goal of adhering to the principles of clean code,<br>
building functions correctly, and performing the best software engineering.
